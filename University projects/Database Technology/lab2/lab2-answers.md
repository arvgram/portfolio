a) 	theatres-screenings 	theatre_name
	movies-screenings 	(movie_name, year) 
	customer-ticket		user_name
	screening-ticket	(start_time, date)

b)	theatre_name maybe?

c) 	screenings

d) 	movies, I would like to use the imdb-key. Maybe screenings if we have different theatres in	the same building, where we would like screenings to be able to start simultaneously.
