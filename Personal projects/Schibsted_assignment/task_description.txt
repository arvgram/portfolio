Welcome to the Schibsted Contextual Team Data Science summer internship take-home assignment!

The goal of this exercise is to reveal underlying patterns in a dataset of images. The dataset has a very specific composition - if you use the right methods it should be possible to clearly reveal this.

You can find the images here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RD1ra2aaxc484GvqzfjRzNfIspyjtWuG/view?usp=sharing

Feel free to use whichever method you think is suitable, with the following constraints:
- Use some kind of computer vision analysis to reveal the underlying patterns
- Present some kind of visualization of your results

You can present results in a notebook, a regular command-line program with associated output plots, or whichever approach you prefer. Please use Python.

Please provide some way of making the analysis reproducible, so that we don't run into problems with software package versions if we try to reproduce your analysis.

Also, please produce a README document explaining your solution.

Good luck!
