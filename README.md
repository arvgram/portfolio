I have worked on a project called "Predicting Forex Rates using NLP" which explores the use of natural language processing techniques to predict foreign exchange rates. The project is available in a separate repository called [FinBERT-LSIMF](https://github.com/simondanielsson/FinBERT-LSIMF). Feel free to explore the code and documentation in the repository. 

## University Projects
In this section, I have included a selection of projects from my university studies. These projects cover a wide range of topics, between object oriented programming to financial economics. Below is a brief overview of some of the key courses I've completed and the corresponding projects I've included:

### Machine Learning
In this course, I gained valuable insights into the field of machine learning and developed a strong foundation in its concepts and techniques. All of the laborations were implementing using MATLAB, which helped me gain insights on what happens under the hood of a shiny Python API. Some notable projects from this course include:

- **Assignment 2**: SVM, PCA and k-means clustering on MNIST
  Description to be added

- **Assignment 3**: Neural Networks
  Description to be added 

### Database Technology
The database technology course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of Relational Database Management Systems. We covered topics such as querying, modelling and implementing Relational Databases and REST API:s. 

- **Project**:
  A REST API for a cookie bakery and delivery system. A SQLite-database and a python app.     
	

### Time Series Analysis
In the time series analysis course, I delved into the intricacies of analysing and modelling time-dependent data. The following projects demonstrate my proficiency in this field:

- **Project**: Temperature modelling
  Description: We modelled the temperature in a Swedish town using ARMA, Box-Jenkins and Kálmán filtering.  

## Additional Projects
Apart from my university projects, I have a few smaller private projects.

- **Image classification**: 
  Description: To learn more about PyTorch I tested classifying an unknown dataset of small images.
